# Installation


## Plugin Installation
Simply download **[tacticalshield.smx](https://github.com/Keplyx/tacticalshield/raw/master/csgo/addons/sourcemod/plugins/tacticalshield.smx)** and place it in your server inside "csgo/addons/sourcemod/plugins/".
A map is currently being made to work along with this plugin. [Get it here!](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1102250426)

## Custom Models Installation
If you want to use custom models for your shield, download the [custom_models.txt](https://github.com/Keplyx/tacticalshield/blob/master/csgo/addons/sourcemod/gamedata/tacticalshield/custom_models.txt) file and place it in your server inside "csgo/addons/sourcemod/gamedata/tacticalshield/".

If players do not see the model, make sure they have downloaded it.
To force players to download models, use the plugin [SM File/Folder Downloader and Precacher](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?p=602270)

## Compatibility
### TTT
This plugin is compatible with [Trouble in Terrorist Town](https://github.com/Bara/TroubleinTerroristTown) for csgo by [Bara](https://github.com/Bara).

Just install TTT and Tactical Shield normally for it to work.
You will want to set the cvars *ts_price "30000"* to prevent players from buying shields outside of the traitor/detective menu.

### Cameras and Drones
This plugin is compatible with [Cameras And Drones](https://keplyx.github.io/cameras-and-drones/).

You can use both plugins without any problem!
If you find a bug, please post an issue on github.
